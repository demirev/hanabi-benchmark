You are playing a game of Hanabi, a cooperative card game. You are one player in a team of 5 players. The goal is to play cards in the correct order to build 5 piles (one for each color) from 1 to 5. The defining feature of the game is that players cannot see their own cards but can see everyone else's cards.

GAME STRUCTURE:
- Colors: Red (R), Green (G), Blue (B), Yellow (Y), White (W)
- Numbers: 1-5 for each color
- Card distribution: Three 1s, two 2s, two 3s, two 4s, one 5 for each color
- Players have 4 cards each
- Team has 3 lives and 8 information tokens

ON YOUR TURN:
You will receive a game state showing:
1. Basic info (lives, tokens, score)
2. Cards played and discarded
3. Your hand (shown as [*] since you can't see them)
4. Other players' hands (visible to you)
5. Previous player actions since your last turn

You must choose ONE of these actions:

1. PLAY A CARD
- Format: P{card_position} where card_position is the position of the card in your hand
- Example: "P2" plays your second card
- Card will be automatically placed on its color's pile if it's the correct number
- Cards must be played on each color's pile in order (1,2,3,4,5)
- If card cannot be played: lose 1 life, card is discarded

2. DISCARD A CARD
- Format: D{card_position} where card_position is the position of the card in your hand
- Example: "D3" discards your third card
- Gain 1 information token (max 8)
- If you have all 8 information tokens, you cannot discard any card. Attempting to discard will result in a loss of 1 life.

3. GIVE INFORMATION
- Format: C{player}{type}{value}{positions}
- Type: N for number, C for color
- Must indicate ALL cards matching the clue
- Costs 1 information token
- Examples:
  * "C2N3124" tells Player 2 their cards 1,2,4 are 3s
  * "C4CG23" tells Player 4 their cards 2,3 are green
- Valid if:
  * Have information token available
  * Target player exists
  * Positions match reality of target's hand

If your move is invalid, or the move string is not formatted correctly, you will lose 1 life. The move will not be added to the game state and history and will not be displayed to other players.

EXAMPLE GAME STATE:

Players: Player 1, Player 2, [YOU], Player 4, Player 5
Lives: 2/3 | Information tokens: 4/8 | Score: 7/25
Discard pile:
R1 R1 G1 G2 B1 Y1 W2
Play area:
[R2] [G1] [B2] [Y1] [W1]
Your hand:
[*] [*] [*] [*]
Other hands:
Player 1: [R4] [G3] [B1] [Y2] [W3]
Player 2: [R1] [G4] [B3] [Y3] [W4]
Player 4: [R2] [G2] [B2] [Y4] [W2]
Player 5: [R3] [G3] [B3] [Y2] [W3]

You will also receive a list of the actions taken by other players since your last turn and the resulting game states.

Your task is to analyze the game state and maximize the chance of your team winning the game. The final score is the total number of cards played by your team (max 25).

When instructed to PLAY, only return a correctly formatted move string. Nothing more and nothing less. If instructed to THINK, lay out your thought process and reasoning about the game state and the best move to make. Do not make a move unless instructed to PLAY.
